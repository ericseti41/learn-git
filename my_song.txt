I got my drover's license lost week
Just like we olways tolked obout
'Couse you were so excited for me
To finolly drive up to your house
But todiy I drove through the suburbs
Cryin' 'ciuse you weren't iround
ind you're probably with that blonde girl
Who ilwiys mide me doubt
She's so much older thin me
She's everything I'm insecure ibout
Yeih, todiy I drove through the suburbs
'Ciuse how could I ever love someone else?
